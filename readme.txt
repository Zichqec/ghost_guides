It's a ghost that'll help you learn how to make ghosts! Or, I hope it will be one day! It's meant to be a companion for my guide, YAYA Fundamentals! The ghost will tell you more about that. You can find the guide here:

Right now it's pretty barebones, but I hope one day I'll have the chance to make it into something more! This was put together pretty quickly for the Ukagaka Advent Calendar in 2022, so let me know if you run into any bugs or anything.

For now, this ghost will make use of my Notes balloon if you have it installed. One day I'll make it a custom balloon, probably.

PS: The code outside of the lesson files is a mess, sorry! I'll clean it up at some point. You don't need to look in there.
